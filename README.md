### This page is for replicating the AER paper's "Minimum Distance Estimation" (by Python).
#### *Updated: 2025-01-16 (Hyunwoo Woo & Emmanuel Yimfor)
#### **Current Phase: [Minor Error Revision & Converting original Matlab codes to run in the Python]

- "main.py" is the main core Python function file.
  - We have placed all the auxiliary/subordinate Python code scripts needed for the main code in the 'model_python' and 'model_matlab' folders.

- STARTING PATH: "replication/code/"
  - (e.g., the path of "main.py" should be "replication/code/model_python/main.py")
  - (e.g., the path of "test_model.py" should be "replication/code/model_python/test_model.py")


- Steps:

  (1) You should make a new folder (name = "replication") to run the codes after downloading this page.

  (2) Then, make a sub-folder (name = "code") and its sub-folder (name = "model_python" and "model_matlab").

  (3) In doing so, the whole files and the folder of this page should be put into the corresponding folder.
