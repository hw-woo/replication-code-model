### This page is for replicating the AER paper's "Minimum Distance Estimation" (by Python).
#### *Updated: 2025-01-18 (Hyunwoo Woo & Emmanuel Yimfor)
#### **Current Phase: [Combining the above code with the STATA codes & Then, checking whether Minimum Distance Estimation runs well]

- "m0_model_run_all" is the main core Python function file.
  - We have placed all the auxiliary/subordinate Python code scripts needed for the main code in the 'depends' folder to improve readability.

- STARTING PATH: "replication/code/model"
  - (e.g., the path of "m0_model_run_all.py" should be "replication/code/model/m0_model_run_all.py")
  - (e.g., the path of "create_tables.py" should be "replication/code/model/depends/create_tables")


- Steps:

  (1) You should make a new folder (name = "replication") to run the codes after downloading this page.

  (2) Then, make a sub-folder (name = "code") and its sub-folder (name = "model").

  (3) In doing so, the whole files and the folder of this page should be put into the "replication/code/model" folder.
